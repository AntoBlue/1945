Features:  
-Player with animated sprite, collisions, life bar and extra lives, can be moved with arrow keys.   
-Bullet pooling for both player and enemies. Enemies and background islands are also pooled.  
-Shoot a constant stream of bullets by keeping the space bar pressed.  
-Infinite enemies that spawn randomly from outside the screen, descending from top to bottom. They shoot bullets in front of themselves which will harm the player if collided. They have their own collisions and can be destroyed by the player's bullets.  
-If the player's energy bar is fully depleted, they will die and lose a life, as seen in the UI. The player will respawn in the start position three seconds later.  
-If the player dies and consumes all lives, they will not respawn; this is a Game Over.
